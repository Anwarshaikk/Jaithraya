## 1. Project Overview & Core Goals

This document outlines the strategy and execution plan for developing a modern, high-performance website for [Client's Cleaning Service Name].

The primary goal is not just to create an online brochure, but to build a powerful business asset that achieves three key objectives:

1.  **Generate Leads:** The site's primary function is to convert visitors into paying customers through a seamless "Get a Quote" or "Book Now" process.
2.  **Build Trust & Credibility:** Professionally showcase the quality of service, display customer testimonials, and clearly communicate the company's value proposition.
3.  **Streamline Operations:** Reduce administrative overhead by answering common questions (FAQs), qualifying leads, and automating the initial booking inquiry.

## 2. Core Features & Functionality (Minimum Viable Product)

We will focus on a core set of high-impact features for the initial launch, built with a component-based architecture for future scalability.

*   **Homepage:**
    *   **Hero Section:** A compelling headline, a high-quality image/video of the team in action, and a prominent "Get a Free Estimate" Call-to-Action (CTA) button.
    *   **Services Overview:** A clear, icon-based summary of services offered (e.g., Residential, Commercial, Deep Cleaning).
    *   **Trust-Building Section:** Featuring customer testimonials, logos of any notable clients, and key value propositions (e.g., "Licensed & Insured," "Eco-Friendly Products").
    *   **How It Works:** A simple 3-step visual guide to the booking process.

*   **Services Page:**
    *   A detailed page for each core service, including what's included, pricing information (or a pricing model), and service-specific FAQs.

*   **About Us Page:**
    *   Introduce the owner and the team. Share the company's story, mission, and commitment to quality. This is key for building a personal connection.

*   **"Get an Estimate" / Booking Form:**
    *   A multi-step, user-friendly form that captures necessary details (service type, square footage, contact info) without overwhelming the user.
    *   This form will be integrated to send notifications directly to the owner's email or a simple CRM.

*   **Contact Page:**
    *   Clear contact information, a simple contact form, business hours, and an embedded Google Map of the service area.

## 3. Technology Stack Recommendation

We will use a modern, enterprise-grade technology stack to ensure performance, security, and maintainability.

*   **Frontend Framework:** **Next.js (React)** - This provides significant advantages:
    *   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** For exceptional performance and out-of-the-box Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
    *   **Component-Based:** We build reusable components (like buttons, forms, testimonials) which makes the site easier to update and maintain.
    *   **Scalability:** Trusted by major companies like Netflix and Vercel.
*   **Styling:** **CSS Modules or Styled Components** - To ensure styles are encapsulated and don't conflict, which is critical for long-term maintenance. We will avoid libraries like Tailwind CSS to keep the build lightweight and custom [[memory:7832036]].
*   **Deployment:** **Vercel / Netlify** - These platforms offer best-in-class performance, automatic deployments, and a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) to ensure the site is fast for all users.

## 4. Design & User Experience (UX) Philosophy

*   **Mobile-First Design:** The website will be designed for a perfect experience on mobile phones first, then adapted for tablets and desktops. This is crucial as a majority of local service searches happen on mobile.
*   **Accessibility (A11Y):** We will adhere to WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure the site is usable by people with disabilities.
*   **Performance-Obsessed:** Our goal is to achieve a Google PageSpeed Insights score of 90+ by optimizing images, leveraging modern code practices, and ensuring fast server response times.
